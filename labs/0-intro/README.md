## intro

The code for the intro lab is pretty lightweight (no hardware
required).  There's a bunch of C code examples based on [C
Traps and Pitfalls](./docs/CTraps.pdf) by Koenig in the [c-traps
directory](./c-traps).  Go through and make sure you understand the
issues.   Useful reminders even if you know them!
